<h2>My Past</h2>
As a former educator I have been on the teaching side of things for about 6 years. When I left education to become a software crafter I found that time has served me well as a learner. I am more focused, I have the ability to comprehend new information with a greater amount of ease, and I find myself in love with learning.

When I was a student in High School as well as in College, I found myself for a lack of better words, annoyed with the status quo. Education was more about rote learning than finding new experiences and seeking enjoyment and pleasure in learning.

When I left graduate school to become a High School educator, I was determined to not be like those other teachers and create great learning environments for my students. I will admit that the task was not easy and it was very easy to become a 'lazy' teacher who's main focus was to just lecture and expect students to learn. I will say that I was not remotely close to perfecting my teaching craft, but I do believe I made the best effort to be different than the status quo.

There is a network of Schools called Big Picture Learning Schools, where an emphasis is placed on learning through real world experiences. Student are released out into the neighborhood to seek out internships throughout the year and actually go to these internships during the school day. This concept, struck me as a viable option to educate youth. This is where the concept of an apprenticeship and my introduction to 8th Light began.

<h2>The Apprenticeship Model</h2>
I remember thinking to myself that a traditional lecture/rote learning model would not help me move into a new career in software development. I knew that an apprenticeship would yield greater gains under the tutelage of a mentor. Lucky for me, I was given two!

What I find interesting about the apprenticeship model at 8th Light is there is both a hands on and hands off approach. You may be saying...that makes no sense, but let me explain.

<h3>Hands Off</h3>
At 8th Light you as the apprentice are the sole person responsible for your progress. You get as much as you want out of the program based upon how much you put in. For example, I found myself often using my library card to checkout ebooks pertaining to the project at hand. My mentors did not ask me to do this, but it was something I needed to do to succeed.

<h3>Hands On</h3>
One of the trickiest parts to manage is the interactions you have with your mentor. Your mentor is not your personal teacher/tutor. Your mentor also has a full time job to tend to. So what is the best way to get the needed "hands on" you might need? Simply put, you have to be prepared to ask for help. I struggled with this concept early on, most likely due to the fact that I didn't want to bother my mentors with additional work, but I had to realize that they signed up to be mentors for a reason. So, with that, communication is key, and with that communication you will get the hands on help you need to succeed.

<h2>Where to go From Here</h2>
As I reflect on my experience I have found that I had some great gains as a learner, but also some significant failures as a communicator, but in the grand scheme of things, it is best to make these mistakes early and often to avoid making these mistakes in the future. I must admit there were times that were a bit shaky, but I keep reminding myself that having a growth mindset, is the only way I will grow as a learner and a professional. This experience has struck at the heart of some of my weaknesses that I experience as a young adult all the way to a professional educator. It has made me aware of some of the things I need to work on, and with that I look forward to what is ahead.
