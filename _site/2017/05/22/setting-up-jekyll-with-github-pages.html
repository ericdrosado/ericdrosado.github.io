<h2> Intro: </h2>
<p>Well, that was painful for a newbie… but then again, no pain…no gain! Cheesy lines aside, Jekyll is not as intuitive as it might seem from a beginners perspective. The documentation is heavy on jargon and there are multiple resources on both GitHub Pages and Jekyll, which have differing setup procedures. They do point to a great resource in Jonathan McGlone’s <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"> Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub </a>. Although a great resource that really allows you to personalize your page, you can bypass this tutorial to get a simple blog up and running in a matter of minutes using this quick setup guide that I have written below with the help of documentation from GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and McGlone’s tutorial.</p>
