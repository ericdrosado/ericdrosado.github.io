<h2> Intro </h2>
<p>In the past I have worked through a variety of tutorials involving Javascript, and I have also made a few small projects along the way. This time around, I found myself particularly interested in the concept of “this,” as it still alludes my understanding completely. This post is an attempt to summarize ‘this’ basics from a great article I found called <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/">“Understand Javascript’s ‘this’ with Clarity, and Master It.”</a></p>

<h2> Think of 'this' as a Pronoun </h2>
<p>In case you need a refresher on the meaning of a pronoun, it is a word that substitutes for a noun, a person, place, or thing. A few examples would be he, she, or it. They take the place of a noun for simplicity and prevents sentences like: “Eric likes to run because Eric enjoys exercise.” The more accepted sentence structure would be: “Eric likes to run because he enjoys exercise.” Now, as a reader you understand the context of ‘he’ because it clearly relates to the noun ‘Eric.’ Now, ‘this’ works in a similar fashion. Lets take a look at an example:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">pet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Dog"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Wrigley"</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="nx">petDescription</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">pet</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">" is a"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">pet</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now notice that within the petDescription function we call out to the pet object to obtain it’s properties ‘type’ and ‘name.’ No big secrets exposed here, but this is a prime opportunity to utilize the ‘this’ keyword as our “pronoun:”</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">pet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Dog"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Wrigley"</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="nx">petDescription</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">" is a"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now, seeing this code we have a sense for the context of ‘this’ because the function is a property of our pet object. So in this case ‘this’ clearly refers to ‘pet.’</p>

<h2> Using 'this' Globally </h2>
<p>When utilizing ‘this’ through a global scope we have to understand that ‘window’ will represent our global object, unless in strict mode. So, lets take a look at the following:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"cat"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Rhino"</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="nx">petDescription</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">" is a"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">pet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Dog"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Wrigley"</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="nx">petDescription</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">" is a"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">petDescription</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If we called the petDescription function outside of the pet object, what do you expect to get for your pet description? Well, you would get “Rhino is a cat” as your description as opposed to “Wrigley is a dog” in this particular case. Because we are running petDescription in a global context we are essentially saying ‘window.petDescription’. If I wanted to get “Wrigley is a dog” I would have to call ‘pet.petDescription()’.</p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>Thinking of ‘this’ as a pronoun greatly simplifies the concept of ‘this’. I still highly recommend reading  <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/">“Understand Javascript’s ‘this’ with Clarity, and Master It”</a> for additional clarity and helpful tips. Otherwise, this is enough of ‘this’ to get you through your first JS project.</p>
